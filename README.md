# SNAKE GAME js

## Context
It's a project I put in place to practice JavaScript, HTML, CSS.  
I first tried it using div's, than I stumbled accross the HTML canvas element, and a good explanation from 'CodeExplainedRepo' (in references)

> ## ToDo's  
> - [ ] game over screen
> - [ ] end/reset function
> - [ ] keep high score of session
> - [ ] do not spawn goal on snake
> - [ ] make it looks good :smile:
