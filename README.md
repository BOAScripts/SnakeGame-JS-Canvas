# SNAKE GAME js

## Context

It's a project I put in place to practice JavaScript, HTML, CSS.  
I first tried it using div's, than I stumbled across the HTML canvas element, and a good explanation from 'CodeExplainedRepo' (in references)

## Try it

You can try this repo [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BOAScripts/SnakeGame-JS-Canvas/blob/main/index.html)

## ToDo's  

- [ ] show controls on start screen
- [ ] change preview img corresponding to gameSize selected
- [ ] vertical center endScreen
- [ ] add some sound effect
- [ ] spawn "enemy" blocks 
- [ ] make it prettier :smile:

- [x] do not spawn goal on snake  
-> can still spawn on same location ...
